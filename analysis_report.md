# Analysis Report

 1. **Time and Visitation Trends (1979-2023)**

    Recreational Hours and Visits: From 1979 to 2023, recreational hours in national parks increased from 507 million to 732 million hours annually, with visits growing faster than hours, suggesting shorter average visit durations over time.
    Impact of COVID-19: A significant drop in visitation was observed in 2020, attributed to the pandemic, with a rebound in subsequent years.
    Seasonal Distribution: In 2023, visitation peaked during the summer months, with July witnessing the highest hours at approximately 125 million, and January the lowest at about 18 million.

2. **Biodiversity and Visitation**

    Species Data Analysis: A scatter plot of unique species counts against recreational hours shows a moderate correlation (0.58), indicating that parks with higher biodiversity tend to attract more visitors. The Great Smoky Mountains, noted for its biodiversity, topped the list with almost 100 million recreational hours.
    Specific Species Categories: Further analysis revealed varying degrees of correlation between recreational hours and different species categories, with vascular plants and mammals showing higher correlations, while fish displayed a weak inverse relationship.

3. **Climate and Visitation**

    Temperature Analysis: The 2023 data displayed no strong correlation between average monthly temperatures and visitation hours. However, the coldest parks generally had less visitation, which correlates with their remote locations and accessibility issues.
    Remote Locations: Parks in extreme locations, like the Alaskan wilderness or American Samoa, showed significantly lower visitation, suggesting that remoteness is a critical factor in visitor numbers.

**Excluded Variables**

Acreage and Entrance Fees: These variables were analyzed but did not show significant correlations with visitation patterns and were thus excluded from the main analysis. However, it was noted that Alaska houses over half of the total national park acreage.

**Inclusion of Outliers**

In the analysis, outliers were identified but included in the final dataset as their exclusion did not significantly alter the observed relationships. By retaining these outlying data points, the analysis benefits from a broader dataset, providing a more comprehensive view of national parks' visitation patterns. This approach ensures that the conclusions drawn are robust and reflective of the entire range of national parks, including those with unique or extreme characteristics, and resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.

**Conclusions and Future Research**

Recreational visitation is increasing over time, with peaks during the summer. Parks with richer biodiversity attract more visitors, particularly those with diverse plant and mammal species. Although climate does not show a strong direct correlation with visitation, the remoteness of a park heavily influences visitor numbers.

**Further Questions**

Future analyses might explore why visits are becoming shorter and identify optimal park-time combinations for visitors based on various personal preferences and park offerings. An interactive dashboard could be developed to help users plan visits considering these factors.

**Final Note**

This report underscores the complex interplay between natural characteristics and visitor patterns in national parks, offering insights into managing and promoting these treasured environments more effectively.

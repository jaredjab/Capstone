# National Parks Capstone Project
- Nashville Software School | Data Analytics - (Cohort DDA12)
---
## Summary
- This project explores how specific characteristics of national parks relate to their engagement, both recreationally and non-recreationally. I collected a vast array of 2023 National Park Service data from their public portal, and used Python, Excel, and Tableau to clean, analyze, visualize, and present my findings. Additional general information was sourced via web-scraping Wikipedia. The characteristics I have chosen to dive into are a park's location, area, age, and biodiversity. While daunting at first, and despite many unexpected obstacles, I am very proud of my work on this project!

## Motivation
- I have always been very interested in natural sciences. That interest is usually directed towards astronomy, but over time I am becoming increasingly interested in nature here on Earth. Many of my favorite memories are connected to spectacular places in national parks. I have flown in a small plane over Denali and landed on a glacier in the mountain range, white-water rafted down many rivers throughout Appalachia, and traversed through Death Valley. There are no better places to feel more alive! National parks are amazing places, and I am gladly taking advantage of the opportunity to combine my passion for them with my professional development as a data analyst.

## Data Question
- How do the characteristics of national parks, such as location, area, age, and biodiversity, relate to recreational and non-recreational visitation?

## Minimim Viable Product (MVP)
- A Tableau story
    - I will present the story, moving between dashboards like slides
        - Some slides will be static, like a PowerPoint presentation
        - Some slides will be an interactive dashboard that I will manipulate during the presentation
        - The target audience is data and/or natural science professionals.

## Known Issues and Challenges
- 7 national parks had incomplete data for various/unknown reasons, and were removed from the analysis:
    - American Samoa
    - Haleakala
    - Hawai'i Volcanoes
    - Wrangell-St. Elias
    - Gateway Arch
    - Kings Canyon
    - Sequoia
